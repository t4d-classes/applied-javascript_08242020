# Exercise 10

1. Fully implement save car and cancel car buttons. Be sure to perform your save operation with immutable programming techniques. If you cancel, revert the changes back to the original.

2. If one of the table rows is being edited, the row being edited should change to a view row after the following events

- A car is added
- A car is deleted
- A car is saved

Note: when adding or deleting a car, the changes for the car being edited should not be saved.

3. Ensure it all works!
